        <p>I believe the folks running this criminal justice system should be held to as high of a standard as they subject the population to. In order for me to carry <abbr title="Oleoresin Capsicum, or ''Pepper Spray''">OC</abbr> spray and a Taser as a law enforcement officer, I had to go through an "exposure." An exposure is when they subject you to being sprayed with OC spray, or electrocuted with a Taser. It was explained to me in military police school and at the criminal justice academy that this is done so you know what to expect if someone you are dealing with on the street takes those tools from you and uses them against you, and so you know what you're subjecting someone else to when you use those tools on them. I know that experiencing the exposure, I had a lot more respect for those tools and ended up rarely using them. In 6 years on the military side of law enforcement, and 7 years on the civilian side, I interacted with thousands of people and conducted several hundred arrests. I used my taser a total of 3 times, and never deployed my OC Spray.</p>
        <p>I believe the people responsible for using incarceration on our population as a tool for punishment or corrective action should have an "exposure" as part of their training as well. They could be pulled from their lives for a couple of weeks during law school, the police academy, or whatever training the person involved receives, and be put into jail as an inmate in order to help them gain a better understanding of what exactly they are subjecting someone else to. I believe this should go for everybody that has a part in the process. District attorneys, judges, lawmakers, police etc. They could have done to with them what they did with me, and put their name, picture, and job title all over the news as well as accusing them of violent, heinous crimes so the rest of the jail population can make sure they get the full experience. I believe this may give them pause before they decide to use the "tool" of incarceration against people as liberally as they do now.</p>

    <div id="collapseTwo" class="accordion-collapse collapse" data-bs-parent="#accordionExample">
      <div class="accordion-body">
        <p>As a police officer, I was required to meet a "burden of proof" to <a href="https://www.notguiltyattorneys.com/difference-between-reasonable-articulable-suspicion-probable-cause-in-maine/" target="blank">stop a vehicle (reasonable suspicion), or conduct searches, have search warrants approved, and make arrests (probable cause)</a>. If I conducted those tasks without meeting those burdens of proof, I would be fired, lose my certification as a law enforcement officer, and subjected to a civil suit. The DA's Office is <a href="https://www.mainelegislature.org/legis/statutes/17-A/title17-Asec32.html#:~:text=A%20person%20may%20not%20be,State%20beyond%20a%20reasonable%20doubt." target="blank">supposed to prove a case beyond a reasonable doubt</a>, a much <a href="https://www.notguiltyattorneys.com/standards-and-burdens-of-proof-and-the-meaning-of-beyond-a-reasonable-doubt/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CBeyond%20a%20reasonable%20doubt%E2%80%9D%20is,have%20the%20burden%20of%20proof." target="blank">higher standard than probable cause</a>, in order to convict someone of a crime. In being on this side of the system I've noticed that the DA's office will take cases submitted by the police, then tack several blown up charges onto the case, raise the bail up because of the more severe charges, and make the person sit in jail until they take a plea deal.</p>
        <p>By making the accused person take a plea deal, they get around having to prove a crime beyond a reasonable doubt. By making the accused sit in jail until they take the deal, they take that accused person's voice away as well. If the prosecutor, and anyone else involved in bringing forth or pushing bogus charges on a case, was held accountable for charges that end up dismissed because they are unable to prove them beyond a reasonable doubt (whether it's through a monetary sanction, civil liability, suspension of license to practice law, etc), I believe things in the system would change drastically.</p>

      <div class="accordion-body">
        <p>One thing I've noticed being on this side of the wall is that there is a segment of the population that is constantly in and out of jail and prison, and they've just accepted it as a part of their life. They call it being on an "installment plan." They'll take a plea deal to be on probation after release so they can get out sooner than if they did straight time, planning that they'll go back to committing criminal conduct, end up failing probation and be back in here anyway just so they don't have to do all the time at once. They don't seem to care about becoming productive members of society or bettering themselves.</p>
        <p>There is another segment of the population I've noticed as well, the "lifers," or folks with a life sentence. Within that population, there are some that have been in for a long time, have made some drastic changes to their lifestyle, way of thinking, and could potentially be extremely productive members of society, but will still be here for the rest of their lives, sometimes based off of one incident.</p>
        <p>It doesn't make sense to me that there doesn't seem to be some kind of incentive for the people that are actually trying to better themselves, can demonstrate how they've grown, and could positively contribute to society, and there is no disincentive for the people who use incarceration as their time to "learn how to be a better criminal" or party and plan to just get out and reoffend.</p>
