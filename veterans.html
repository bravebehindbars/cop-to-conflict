    <p> <i><u>Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</u></i> is a mental health problem that can occur after a traumatic event like war, assault, disaster, or experiencing or witnessing a life-threatening or other traumatic event. Anyone can develop PTSD at any age. Some factors can increase the chance that someone will have PTSD, many of which are not under that person's control. For example, having a very intense or long-lasting traumatic event or getting injured during the event can make it more likely that a person will develop PTSD. PTSD is also more common after certain types of trauma, like combat and sexual assault. Some common symptoms of PTSD include but are not limited to:</p>
    <ul class="paragraph"> 
      <li>Reliving the event</li>
      <li>Avoiding things that remind you of the event</li>
      <li>Having more negative thoughts or feelings than before the event</li>
      <li>Feeling on-edge or keyed-up (also called hyperarousal or hypervigilance)</li>

    <p>Here are some facts about veterans and incarceration:
      <ul>
        <li>According to a 2017 Bureau of Justice study, one in three veterans report having been arrested at least once in their lives.</li>
        <li>In a 2016 Department of Justice report, 107,000 veterans were recorded as being incarcerated in federal or state prisons, and over one in four of those veterans had combat experience.</li> 
        <li>Veterans are now twice as likely as nonveterans to face incarceration, and on average veterans face longer sentences than nonveterans.</li>
        <li>Surveys have found that between 5% and 38% of veterans have PTSD, and veterans suffering from PTSD have a 61% higher chance of involvement in the criminal justice system than veterans who do not have PTSD, and the odds of being arrested for a violent offense are 59% greater.</li>
        <li>According to the <a href="https://bjs.ojp.gov/content/pub/pdf/Llgsfp.pdf" target="blank"> Bureau of Justice</a>, an estimated 5.1% (about one in twenty) of persons in the U.S. will serve time in state or federal prison in their lifetime. Veterans make up 6.5% of the U.S. population, yet approximately 31% (about one in three) of veterans will face incarceration in their lifetime.</li>
        <li>These facts were found in an <a href="https://thewarhorse.org/military-veterans-incarcerated-at-higher-rates-lack-support/#:~:text=Veterans%20are%20now%20twice%20as,in%20state%20or%20federal%20prisons." target="blank"> article on "The War Horse" news site, </a> and <a href="https://counciloncj.org/from-service-to-sentencing-unraveling-risk-factors-for-criminal-justice-involvement-among-u-s-veterans/" target="blank"> article from the Council on Criminal Justice.</a></li>

    </button>
  </h2>
  <div id="collapseFour" class="accordion-collapse collapse" data-bs-parent="#accordionExample">
    <div class="accordion-body">
      <p>I believe our system is overburdened and lacking in support for the majority of people in it, and especially for veterans. There are so many organizations that can provide services to veterans, and really want to help. In speaking to these organizations they tell me the biggest barrier is not being allowed to do much work with us due to restrictive <abbr title="Department Of Corrections">DOC</abbr> policies. I believe that if DOC facilities are unable to give veterans the support they need while incarcerated, and set them up for transition into the community, they should have some way of accommodating the services of those organizations.</p> 
      <p>I spoke with one organization, <a href="https://boothbay-vets.com/" target="_blank">BoothBay V.E.T.S. Inc.</a> They have a program where they work with incarcerated individuals and give them training and jobs building temporary housing for homeless veterans. Unfortunately, the facility I'm at and several other facilities in the state have strict policies that prevent people from participating in that program.</p>
      <p>I've also heard that several county jails, and other state facilities, have programs and units within the facility specifically for veterans. In speaking with other inmates I've heard these things are extremely helpful, and I think it's a great start. I'd hope that eventually the system will be able to expand those types of programs.</p>
